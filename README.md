# advent-of-code-2020

These are my solutions for the Advent Of Code 2020 problems. 

- They are not meant for optimization, they are only meant for finding out the answer. 
- Please note that some solutions may not directly provide the required answer and require some manual processing. 
- Day 1 and 2 only have the code for part 2 of the problem. Subsequent days have code for both parts.

- Currently, **days 13 and 14 only have solutions for part 1.** I haven't solved part 2 yet, I will update the code when I do.
